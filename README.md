This project aims to calculate the cumulative historical return, annualized return, and annualized volatility of a portfolio composed of multiple financial assets. Historical price data of assets and their respective weights in the portfolio are used to perform these calculations.

## Project Objectives

1. **Cumulative Historical Return of the Portfolio**: Visualize how the portfolio's return has evolved over time.
2. **Annualized Return**: Calculate the expected annual return of the portfolio based on the historical daily returns.
3. **Annualized Volatility**: Measure the standard deviation of daily returns to understand the risk associated with the portfolio.
